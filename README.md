PHPMachine
===========

Webmachine inspired REST toolkit for PHP.

Overview
-----------

PHPMachine is implemented with functional php to stay closer to the original language of Erlang.
Resources are composed of a set of callback functions that return information about a resource.

Why?

Your boss says PHP only.  So if you can't go to Webmachine, have Webmachine come to you.
